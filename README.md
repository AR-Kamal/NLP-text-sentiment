# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

A beautiful web application for predicting sentiment of product reviews using Machine Learning.
Demo: https://nlp-text-sentiment-n6tsd5shwofqsvksyjuivb.streamlit.app/

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier** with probability scores
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** predictions
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Beautiful, user-friendly interface
- Export results functionality
- Example reviews for quick testing

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Prepare Model Files

Make sure you have these files in the same directory as `app.py`:
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
- `naive_bayes_model.pkl`
- `svm_model.pkl`
- `label_encoder.pkl`

These files are generated from your Jupyter notebook when you save the models.

### Step 3: Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

1. **Enter a review** in the text area
2. **Click "Analyze Sentiment"** button
3. **View predictions** from both models
4. **Compare results** between Naive Bayes and SVM
5. **Download results** as a text file

## Quick Examples

Try these example reviews:

**Positive:**
- "Excellent product! Highly recommend!"
- "Amazing quality, worth every penny"

**Negative:**
- "Terrible quality, waste of money"
- "Very disappointed, not as described"

**Neutral:**
- "It's okay, nothing special"
- "Average product, decent price"

## How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Remove URLs, HTML tags, punctuation
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal (keeping negations)
   - Lemmatization

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - TF-IDF vectorization (5,000 features)
   - Bigrams for context

3. **Prediction:**
   - Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classification
   - SVM: Geometric classification

4. **Output:**
   - Sentiment class (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
   - Confidence scores
   - Probability distributions

## Model Performance 📊

| Model | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Naive Bayes | ~84% | Speed, interpretability |
| SVM | ~88% | Overall accuracy |

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Error: "Model file not found"
- Ensure all `.pkl` files are in the same directory as `app.py`
- Check that you've saved the models in your Jupyter notebook

### Error: "No module named 'streamlit'"
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### Port already in use
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```
## Deployment

### Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Free!)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your repository
4. Deploy!

### Deploy to Heroku

1. Create `Procfile`:
```
web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py
```

2. Create `setup.sh`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
echo "\
[server]\n\
port = $PORT\n\
enableCORS = false\n\
headless = true\n\
\n\
" > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```
